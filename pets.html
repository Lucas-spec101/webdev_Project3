      <h3>Conyac</h3>
      <img src="images/conyac1.jpg" alt="Picture of my dog Conyac">
      <p>This is my first dog and my best bud scine I was in grade school Conyac, he is a pitbull. People would always be scared of him, but he was always nice and playful (Unless you are a rodent). He would always be there for me, and I only wish I could have given him more.</p>

      <h3>Bella</h3>
      <img src="images/bella1.jpg" alt="Picture of my dog Bella">
      <p>This is my second dog Bella, she is a labrador. She is very timid/shy but when you start playing around with her, she starts to open up and plays around too. She is very nice around other people but is always up in your business. She is also absolutly terrified of fireworks, so during the 4th of July she has to sleep in my room or else she will howl all night.</p>

      <h3>Orion</h3>
      <img src="images/orion1.jpg" alt="Picture of my dog Orion">
      <p>The newest addition to my family Orion, he is a pomsky. This is my fathers dream dog and when one of our neighbors said that their dogs had a litter he jumped on the chance to get one. He is extremly energetic (almost to a fault), he will everything anything to grab your attention for you to play with him. However, when you play tug-of-war he will always end up bitting you and he's got teath like little daggers (a menace you say).</p>
