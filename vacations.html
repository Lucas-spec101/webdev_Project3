    <h2>Vacation Highlights</h2>
    <div class="vacation">
      <h3>San Diego</h3>
      <p>My family went here when I was younger to celebrate one of my brothers graduation from the Marine's bootcamp. I really liked the celebration, but the overall quality of the area was not to be desired. I much prefer to live here in Chicago where the weather has more randomness, rather than just hot and humid.</p>

      <h3>Disneyland</h3>
      <p>This little adventure was not the greatest I was hoping for, but it was nice to at least experience it at least once. Unfortunatly, I had also gotten sick during my time out there so that also kind of ruined the experience.</p>

    <div class="vacation">
      <h3>Skiing</h3>
      <p>This was my very first (and likely last) time skiing. It was a very exhilarating experience and I enjoyed it a lot. However, I cannot say that my brother had the same, well kind of. He said that he enjoyed it but he also fell part way near the end of the bigger hills; he had his faced all scratched up and had some bruises.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="vacation">
      <h3>Wyoming</h3>
      <p>This was my first ever trip out of state by myself. It was a pretty nerve-racking adventure because I was out in the middle of nowhere in the mountains. It was private property but still worrysome. Overall, it was a fun little outing watching my campmates get scared because of a mouse that was just outside our tent.</p>
